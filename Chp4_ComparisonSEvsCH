Adaptation across latitude may be driven by temperature during the growth season, or by the season length. Both of these have been
suggested previously, and in my SE MS I find that adaptation to temperature might be important. 

Here I investigate which of the two variables are the most important, and determine whether adaptation across elevation is also driven
by season length or temperature during the growth season. 

Strategy: 

1. Identify candidate adaptive loci. 
  a)I'm using EAA (LFMM and BayENV) to identify loci associated with season length or temperature during
the breeding season. 
  b)I'm identifying outlier loci using Bayescan, PCAdapt, and XtX from Bayenv2
  
2. Test whether these are important across the gradient compared with neutral loci: 
  a) Gradient forest analysis
  b) GDM
  
3) Identify regions with high genomic turnover -> predict the effects of future climate change. 




## Part1: Identify Candidate adaptive loci

### a) Env. Assoc. Analyses (EAA)

I'm using mean temperature 60 days after laying and season length as the two main variables here.
