#Genomics Turnover

How does genomic turnover compare between CH and SE? 

Speak to Ryan about formulating a good question here. I want to make use of RF to look at adaptive potential in these two systems. 

Motivation: AmNat??

Genomic resources are unfeasible for many systems. We need a way to make predictions in non-model systems with few genomic resources. 

A recently proposed method for looking into this: 

1. Fitzpatrick?? Ryan's got code for this
