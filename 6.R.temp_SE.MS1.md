##Population genomics of Rana temporaria across the latitudinal environmental gradient in Scandinavia. 


LHT variation in Rana temporaria across latitude. 

Very little known about their population structure. 

Aim: 

Detect loci associated with environment across latitude

1. Characterise population structure

2. Genome scan for ecologically relevant loci related to the latitudinal gradient. 

3. Spatial interpolation of genomic turnover/ temporal interpolation of genomic turnover

Compare to Johannsen et al. 2006

 (i) Are there clear geographic patterns of within population genetic variability and degree of among population genetic variability in this species? 
 
 (ii) Are there clear geographic patterns of occurrence and population sizes in this species? 
 
 (iii) Is there evidence that the current patterns of genetic variability and differentiation in this species are better explained by their current demography, rather than their colonization history?

1. What is the fine-scale connectivity within each sampling area?

2. IBD vs IBE?

3. Signatures of selection? 

I will run analyses based on Laurent et al. 2015 (white sand lizards) http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.13385/epdf

1. Filter SNPs 

2. PCA

3. Structure analysis

4. Heterozygosity

5. Filter outliers??

6. Fst table


##Data

1. All data

2. Subset of the data adjusted for the number of reads (rerun pyRAD)

###Dataset1



###Dataset2 

copy all the .edit files from SEFinalSamples.edits > SEFinalSamples/subset5Mil.SE/edits

count the reads for each sample

```
grep -c ^'>' *edit -> SE.readcount
```

Downsample to 1Mil reads per sample. (Mostly because Finland samples have such few reads, and this population would drop out if I increased the minimum number of reads). 

Use a perl script (random_sequence_sample.pl). Which I've uploaded on gdc (and the mac). 


```
for i in edits/*.fq.trim.edit; do perl random_sequence_sample.pl -i $i -o subset/$i.subset.edit -n 1000000; done
```
