#Adaptation to similar environmental gradients at very different spatial scales

- What is the genomic signature of adaptation to the same environmental gradient?
- When can we expect parallel evolution? 
      - spatial scale
      - gene flow
      - standing genetic variation
      - trait complexity
      - strength of selection


Simulations??
