- What is the genomic signature of adaptation to the same environmental gradient?
- When can we expect parallel evolution? 
      - spatial scale
      - gene flow
      - standing genetic variation
      - trait complexity
      - strength of selection


Simulations??

Akerman & BÃ¼rger 2012
"We consider a population subdivided into two demes connected by migration
in which selection acts in opposite direction.We explore the effects of recombination
and migration on the maintenance of multilocus polymorphism, on local adaptation,
and on differentiation by employing a deterministic model with genic selection on
two linked diallelic loci (i.e., no dominance or epistasis)."
