#CH: Adaptation to elevation

1. What are the signals of adaptation to elevation? 

2. Are they the same across different elevational gradients? 

3. Genomic turnover -> ie. where is the most selective pressure & what will the effects of future climate be?


##Data generation


##Datasets & Summary statistics

PCA to decide how to divide pops

1. All CH



2. CHN-E



3. CHN-W



4. CHS-VS



5. CHS-TI



6. CHN.2



7. CHS.2

##Environmental variables: PCA

Decide which environmental variables to use. This shoudl probably be base on the results from the Landscape genetic analysis.
