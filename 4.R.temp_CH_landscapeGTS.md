#Fine scale connectivity or Rana temporaria at different spatial scales


Question: what determines connectivity between populations across different spatial scales? 
- same environmental gradient
- Very different landscapes

Important paper on the use of Mantel tests in spatial analyses: Don't!

I'm interested in the at-site and between-site variables that could determine connectivity between populations. 

###Part 1. Connectivity will be determined by at and between site variables, rather than absolute distance. For between site, I hypothesise that topographic complexity with create increased resistance to geneflow. 
At site, I hypothesise that site quality i.t.o pond size, and climate i.t.o developmental degree days, will explain migration between ponds. 

###Part 2. Major barriers to dispersal? Ridges? How will I define this? 
Monmoniers algorithm 

###Part 3. Can I identify the range edge? I hypothesis that the range edge is determined by limited developmental time for the tadpoles. ie. duration of snow cover (snow free days), or developmental degree days. 

#####Part 1: Gravity Model

As implemented in Murphy et al. 2010.
