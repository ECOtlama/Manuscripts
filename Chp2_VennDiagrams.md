## Venn Diagrams 

Calculating the overlap in loci identified for all the different datasets. 

I'm showing: 

1. Venn Diagram within analysis for 
  
  1. LFMM
  
  2. bayEnv2

2. overlap between LFMM, Bayenv2, PCadapt, XtX within each region (i.e. 6 plots)

3. Overlap between all candidate loci identified for CHall, CHN, CHS, CZ

4. Overlap between all candidate loci identified for CHS, CHS.TI, CHS.VS


### 1.1 Venn Diagram for loci within LFMM


##### CHall

##### CHN

##### CHS

##### CZ

##### CHS.VS

##### CHS.TI


### 1.2 Venn Diagram for loci within BayEnv2


##### CHall

##### CHN

##### CHS

##### CZ

##### CHS.VS

##### CHS.TI



### 2 overlap between LFMM, Bayenv2, PCadapt, XtX within each region


##### CHall

##### CHN

##### CHS

##### CZ

##### CHS.VS

##### CHS.TI


### 3. Overlap between all candidate loci identified for CHall, CHN, CHS, CZ


### 4. Overlap between all candidate loci identified for CHS, CHS.TI, CHS.VS
