# CHP4

Adaptation across latitude may be driven by temperature during the growth season, or by the season length. Both of these have been
suggested previously, and in my SE MS I find that adaptation to temperature might be important. 

Here I investigate which of the two variables are the most important, and determine whether adaptation across elevation is also driven
by season length or temperature during the growth season. 

Strategy: 

1. Identify candidate adaptive loci. 
  a)I'm using EAA (LFMM and BayENV) to identify loci associated with season length or temperature during
the breeding season. 
  b)I'm identifying outlier loci using Bayescan, PCAdapt, and XtX from Bayenv2
  
2. Test whether these are important across the gradient compared with neutral loci: 
  a) Gradient forest analysis
  b) GDM
  
3) Identify regions with high genomic turnover -> predict the effects of future climate change. 




## Part1: Identify Candidate adaptive loci

### a) Env. Assoc. Analyses (EAA)

I'm using mean temperature 60 days after laying as temp during development time, and number of days above 6deg C as season length. 

I'm using the same input files for Switzerland as in the Pop Genomics chapter (CHP2)

For SE, I have to filter for MAC as I did for the Swiss populations.

## EAA

### 1. BayEnv2

### 2. LFMM


## Fst outlier analyses

### 1. Bayescan

CH: Results as in CHP2

### 2. PCAdapt

CH: results as in CHP2. 

## RDA

Here I want to see how much of the variation is explained by the candidate loci

## GDM & GF

The aim here is to

1. determine whether temp or season length are the most important in all transects

2. identify any thresholds and compare between transects

3. predict affect of future climates on adaptation: are there more vulnerable regions?
