#Fine scale connectivity or Rana temporaria at different spatial scales

Main challenge: 

Spatially varying patterns of selection. 

This gives an indication of what genomic architecture and pathways are needed for adaptation. 

- Is it the same at a contact zone vs CHN vs CHS locations. 
- Same env gradient, but differring genomic background. 


Question: what determines connectivity between populations across different spatial scales? 
- same environmental gradient
- Very different landscapes

Important paper on the use of Mantel tests in spatial analyses: Don't!
