#Genomics of Adaptation 


I'm interested in the effect of migration on the genomic architecture of selection  

- Are there general patterns underlying the genomics of adaptation? 

- Can we make predictions about this? 

- Looking for sweeps vs environmental associations: which tests are appropriate and when?? 

- Different genomic architectures underlying the same phenotypes?

- But is there a better way or easier way to study and predict adaptation in non-model organisms? 

- We don't have the genomic resources, so we need to be looking for something else. What patterns should we be looking at? 

will develop an integrated population model that can simulate range changes and evolutionary responses, and will enable
model outputs to be compared to genomic, ecological and demographic data using a variety of statistical approaches. The project represents a
fantastic opportunity to gain experience and expertise in linking novel empirical genomic and ecological data with the latest techniques in
modelling and inference in order to test the ecological consequences of climate change for biodiversity.
