# Phylogeography MS: RAD data 

I want to add some RAD data into the Phylogeography paper so that we can submit to a higher impact journal. 

Currently I'm thinking of just presenting population structure, estimates of genetic diversity, and potentially demographic modeling to 
determine the most likely recolonisation history of Switzerland. 

Main message: Higher than expected genetic structure and genetic variation in Switzerland due to colonisation from multiple glacial refutia. 

So the main things I'm showing with the paper are: 

1. Complex genetic structure across Switzerland

which is a consequence of

2. Colonisation from north and south

3. from northern Italy and either northern Italy or the Pyrenees. 

4. Trying to integrate Stefani et al 2012 and Vences et al. 2013 & 2017 results to resolve glacial refugia of Rana temporaria. 

5. Small comment on possible recolonisation routes, and that the same sequences need to be generated for Italian and European samples
to resolve this problem.
