#Post-glacial secondary contact across the Swiss Alps results in regions of higher adaptive potential in the common frog *Rana temporaria*


Our main objective is to determine whether the contact zone in the Swiss Alps has provided new genomic combinations which should signals of positive selection. 

Specifically we: 

1. Determine the population structure across the contact zone based on ddRAD markers

2. We determine whether the mitochondrial and genomic geographic clines are congruent

3. Determine whether one or the other mitochondrial cline has a selective advantage at the contact zone or at high elevations

4. Identify loci with signals of either 1)overdominance, 2) selection against, 3)
